# Stress Level Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the stress level of individuals based on their lifestyle and health data using machine learning techniques. The model utilizes a dataset focused on sleep health and lifestyle factors.

## Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- Sleep duration
- Quality of sleep
- Physical activity level
- Daily steps
- Heart rate
- BMI
- Gender and Age

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training using multiple ML algorithms
- Evaluation of model performance
- Final prediction system

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stress-level-prediction.git
   cd stress-level-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the Jupyter notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "stresslevel prediction.ipynb"
   ```

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance was assessed using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
